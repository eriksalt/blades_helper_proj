supply_problems, Integration - Logistics support must coordinate well with the existing command structure and strategic planning. Problems - The PCs are working with a corrupt native officer who won’t release supplies without a favor. The PCs are being ordered to carry out a delivery according to operational plans that no longer apply and only enemy forces are in the area., Anticipation - logistical planners have to be able to foresee the supplies and force deployments that will be necessary. Problems - The natives don’t use a particular type of weapon or vehicle and so don’t think to provide vital components to the mercenaries. The brass has grossly overestimated the amount of a particular supply the unit will need and now the enemy or grasping comrades or corrupt local officials are coming for it., Responsiveness - what you need when your anticipation proves insufficient. Pronlems - Getting a supply through a block until a lasting supply line can be set up. A corrupt officer or local has stolen suddenly-needed supplies and they have to be recovered before it’s too late. The emergency supplies exist but have been seized by a sudden enemy thrust that needs to be driven back., Economy - recognizes that there is only so much to go around and it needs to go where it matters most. Problems - A mistake has grossly under-equipped the PCs’ unit with something important. Corrupt native officials are reporting deliveries that they never made thus leaving HQ to think the unit’s fully supplied and refusing to issue more., Survivability - Stuff breaks or goes bad. Problems - A native fungus eats away components of a PC’s equipment. Desperate locals are willing to risk their lives to steal rations. Broken magic is threatening black shot with acid rain and the only good cover is currently in enemy hands., Continuity - Keeping supply lines open. Problems - A vital supply road is being threatened by an enemy concentration. The PCs need to head to an outpost and figure out why supplies supposedly forwarded from it never seem to get to the front. An incompetent officer or corrupt native has let a supply route collapse and someone needs to force a new convoy through now-dangerous terrain., Improvisation - The only stock of a vital supply is in the hands of a local grandee of some importance. A tech knows how to fix or mitigate a supply lack but he needs to be fetched out of a bad situation. Somebody’s done a battlefield fix on a problem but it’s going to go catastrophically wrong if the PCs can’t get a vital part to them in time.
